# Middleware Fix - API Route Exclusion

## The Problem You Found üéØ

**Postman works, browser doesn't** - This is a classic middleware interference issue!

### What Was Happening:

**Middleware Configuration (Before):**
```javascript
export const config = {
  matcher: ["/((?!.*\\..*|_next).*)", "/", "/(api|trpc)(.*)"],
  //                                           ^^^^^^^^^^^^
  //                                    This includes ALL API routes!
};

const isByPassRoutes = ["/api(.*)", "/convex(.*)"];
// Middleware tries to bypass API routes, but...
```

**The Race Condition:**
1. **Browser hits** `/api/oauth/google/callback?code=...`
2. **Middleware runs** (because matcher includes API routes)
3. **Authentication check happens** before bypass logic
4. **User might be "unauthenticated"** during OAuth redirect
5. **Middleware interferes** with the request/response
6. **Code parameter gets lost** in the process

**Postman vs Browser:**
- **Postman**: No cookies, no session, simpler request handling
- **Browser**: Has cookies, session state, triggers full middleware pipeline

## The Fix: Exclude API Routes from Middleware

**New Middleware Configuration:**
```javascript
export const config = {
  matcher: [
    "/((?!api|_next/static|_next/image|favicon.ico).*)",
    //     ^^^
    //     Explicitly exclude API routes from middleware
    "/",
  ],
};
```

### What This Does:

#### ‚úÖ API Routes Never Hit Middleware
- `/api/oauth/google/callback` bypasses auth middleware entirely
- No authentication checks on API endpoints
- No interference with OAuth flow

#### ‚úÖ Protected Routes Still Work
- `/campaign/create` still requires authentication
- `/dashboard` still requires authentication
- All other protected routes work as before

#### ‚úÖ Clean Separation
- API routes handle their own logic
- Page routes handle authentication via middleware
- No conflicts between the two

## Testing the Fix:

### 1. Test API Route Directly
```bash
# This should work in both Postman AND browser now
curl "https://your-app.com/api/oauth/google/callback?code=test&state=test"
```

### 2. Test OAuth Flow
1. Click "Connect Google Ads"
2. Authorize on Google
3. **Check server logs** - should see code parameter
4. **Should NOT see** middleware interference logs

### 3. Verify Protected Routes Still Work
1. Try accessing `/campaign/create` without auth
2. Should redirect to `/auth/sign-in`
3. Protected routes still work as expected

## Why This Fixes the Issue:

### Before (‚ùå Broken):
```
Browser ‚Üí /api/oauth/google/callback?code=...
  ‚Üì
Middleware runs (auth check)
  ‚Üì
Potential interference/session issues
  ‚Üì
Code parameter lost
```

### After (‚úÖ Fixed):
```
Browser ‚Üí /api/oauth/google/callback?code=...
  ‚Üì
No middleware (API route excluded)
  ‚Üì
Direct to route handler
  ‚Üì
Code parameter preserved
```

## Additional Benefits:

### üöÄ Performance
- API routes are faster (no middleware overhead)
- OAuth callbacks are more reliable
- Reduced complexity in request pipeline

### üîí Security
- API routes can handle their own authentication
- Clear separation of concerns
- No accidental middleware interference

### üêõ Debugging
- Easier to debug API issues
- Clear distinction between API and page routes
- Middleware logs only show page route activity

## Files Modified:

- ‚úÖ `src/middleware.ts` - Excluded API routes from matcher

## Expected Result:

After this fix:
1. **Postman AND browser** should both work
2. **Code parameter should be preserved** in browser
3. **OAuth flow should complete successfully**
4. **Protected routes should still require authentication**

The middleware was the culprit! By excluding API routes entirely, we eliminate the interference that was causing the code parameter to disappear in the browser. üéâ

## Next Steps:

1. **Restart your dev server** (middleware changes require restart)
2. **Test the OAuth flow** in browser
3. **Check server logs** for the code parameter
4. **Verify protected routes** still work

This should completely resolve the browser vs Postman discrepancy!
