# Requirements Document

## Introduction

The Campaign Creation feature enables PR and content agency users to create new campaigns through a wizard-based interface. Users can either create campaigns from scratch by filling out a comprehensive form with campaign basics, target audience, channels, and KPIs, or import existing campaigns from external platforms like Facebook Ads and Google Ads via their APIs. This feature serves as the foundation for all other PivotPulse functionality, as campaigns are the core entities that will be analyzed, simulated, and optimized.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As an agency owner or editor, I want to create a new campaign from scratch using a step-by-step wizard, so that I can set up all campaign parameters systematically and ensure nothing is missed.

2. WHEN a user completes step 1 (Campaign Basics) THEN the system SHALL validate required fields and allow progression to step 2
3. WHEN a user provides campaign name, description, start date, end date, and budget THEN the system SHALL save this data as a draft
4. WHEN a user navigates between wizard steps THEN the system SHALL preserve previously entered data
5. IF a user tries to proceed without completing required fields THEN the system SHALL display validation errors and prevent progression

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As an agency owner or editor, I want to define my target audience and select marketing channels during campaign creation, so that I can specify who I'm targeting and how I'll reach them.

5. IF a user doesn't select any KPIs THEN the system SHALL require at least one primary success metric

### Requirement 4

5. WHEN a user completes and publishes a campaign THEN the system SHALL remove the corresponding draft

### Requirement 7
