# Requirements Document

## Introduction

The AI Trajectory Simulation Engine is a core enhancement to PivotPulse that will transform the platform from basic ad creation and import functionality into an intelligent predictive analytics system. This feature will leverage AI models to simulate ad and campaign performance trajectories, providing users with probabilistic forecasts of key metrics like CTR, impressions, and engagement over 5-30 day periods. The engine will integrate with existing ad data (both imported from platforms and manually created) and external market data to generate actionable insights and pivot recommendations.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a PR agency owner, I want to simulate the performance trajectory of my ad campaigns using AI predictions, so that I can make data-driven decisions about budget allocation and campaign optimization before launching.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user selects an existing campaign or ad THEN the system SHALL display an option to "Generate AI Simulation"
2. WHEN a user initiates an AI simulation THEN the system SHALL process the ad data (creative content, targeting parameters, budget) and generate probabilistic performance trajectories
3. WHEN the simulation is complete THEN the system SHALL display predicted metrics (CTR, impressions, engagement, reach) with confidence intervals over a 5-30 day timeline
4. IF the user has imported campaigns from Google Ads or Facebook THEN the system SHALL use historical performance data to enhance prediction accuracy
5. WHEN generating predictions THEN the system SHALL incorporate external market factors (competitor activity, seasonal trends) where available

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a content agency owner, I want to see multiple scenario outcomes for my campaigns, so that I can understand best-case, worst-case, and most likely performance scenarios.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN an AI simulation runs THEN the system SHALL generate three trajectory scenarios: optimistic (75th percentile), realistic (50th percentile), and pessimistic (25th percentile)
2. WHEN displaying trajectories THEN the system SHALL show confidence intervals and probability ranges for each prediction point
3. WHEN a user views simulation results THEN the system SHALL highlight key inflection points and potential performance dips or spikes
4. IF external market data is available THEN the system SHALL factor competitor launches, seasonal trends, and market volatility into scenario generation
5. WHEN scenarios are generated THEN the system SHALL provide explanatory text for why each scenario might occur

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a campaign manager, I want the AI to identify potential performance issues early, so that I can proactively adjust my strategy before problems impact results.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the AI detects a predicted performance dip of >20% THEN the system SHALL flag this as a "Risk Alert" in the simulation
2. WHEN risk alerts are generated THEN the system SHALL provide specific reasons for the predicted decline (e.g., "Competitor campaign overlap detected", "Seasonal engagement drop expected")
3. WHEN a simulation shows declining performance THEN the system SHALL suggest specific pivot actions (budget reallocation, creative adjustments, timing changes)
4. IF historical data shows similar patterns THEN the system SHALL reference past campaign learnings in risk assessments
5. WHEN alerts are created THEN the system SHALL allow users to test "what-if" scenarios by adjusting parameters and re-running simulations

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As an agency owner, I want to compare simulated performance against industry benchmarks, so that I can set realistic expectations and identify opportunities for outperformance.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN displaying simulation results THEN the system SHALL show industry benchmark ranges for each metric (CTR, CPC, engagement rate)
2. WHEN benchmarks are available THEN the system SHALL highlight where predicted performance exceeds or falls below industry standards
3. IF competitor data is accessible THEN the system SHALL show how predicted performance compares to similar campaigns in the market
4. WHEN benchmark comparisons are made THEN the system SHALL account for industry vertical, campaign type, and target audience similarities
5. WHEN performance significantly deviates from benchmarks THEN the system SHALL provide explanations and optimization suggestions

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a campaign strategist, I want to simulate the impact of budget changes and timing adjustments, so that I can optimize resource allocation across multiple campaigns.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user adjusts budget parameters in the simulation THEN the system SHALL recalculate trajectories in real-time
2. WHEN timing parameters are modified THEN the system SHALL update predictions to reflect seasonal factors and market timing
3. WHEN multiple campaigns are simulated simultaneously THEN the system SHALL account for potential audience overlap and budget competition effects
4. IF budget is reallocated between campaigns THEN the system SHALL show the combined impact on overall portfolio performance
5. WHEN optimization suggestions are made THEN the system SHALL prioritize changes that improve overall ROI across the campaign portfolio

### Requirement 6

**User Story:** As a data analyst, I want access to the underlying AI model confidence scores and data sources, so that I can validate predictions and understand model limitations.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN viewing simulation results THEN the system SHALL display model confidence scores for each prediction
2. WHEN confidence scores are low (<70%) THEN the system SHALL clearly indicate uncertainty and suggest additional data collection
3. WHEN a user requests detailed analysis THEN the system SHALL show which data sources contributed to each prediction (historical performance, market data, competitor intelligence)
4. IF external API data is unavailable THEN the system SHALL clearly indicate which predictions rely on limited data and adjust confidence accordingly
5. WHEN model performance can be validated against actual results THEN the system SHALL track and display prediction accuracy over time

### Requirement 7

**User Story:** As a technical administrator, I want the AI simulation engine to integrate seamlessly with existing Convex data and authentication, so that simulations respect user permissions and data access controls.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user initiates a simulation THEN the system SHALL only access campaigns and ads within their organization's scope
2. WHEN simulation data is stored THEN the system SHALL use Convex database with proper user association and permissions
3. WHEN external APIs are called THEN the system SHALL use existing OAuth tokens and respect rate limits
4. IF a user lacks permissions for certain data THEN the system SHALL gracefully degrade predictions and inform the user of limitations
5. WHEN simulations are saved THEN the system SHALL maintain audit trails of who ran which simulations and when

### Requirement 8

**User Story:** As a system user, I want AI simulations to complete within reasonable time limits, so that I can iterate quickly on campaign planning without workflow disruption.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a basic simulation is requested THEN the system SHALL complete processing within 30 seconds
2. WHEN complex multi-campaign simulations are run THEN the system SHALL complete within 2 minutes
3. IF processing takes longer than expected THEN the system SHALL show progress indicators and estimated completion time
4. WHEN simulations are queued THEN the system SHALL allow users to continue other work and notify when complete
5. WHEN system load is high THEN the system SHALL prioritize simulations based on user subscription tier and maintain acceptable performance
